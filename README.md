# Data-Engineering-Nanodegree

Data-Engineering-Nanodegree is a program that teach how to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, 
and work with massive datasets. At the end of the program, I arrived to combine my new skills by completing a capstone project.

Apache airflow - PySpark - AWS Redshift - AWS Glue - AWS Athena - Cassandra - PostgreSQL
